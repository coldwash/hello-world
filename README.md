# hello-world
Initial Repository

Hello, I like C# and the fact .net core is open source and cross platform.  
I believe in Agile / Scrum Methodologies, OOP, CI/CD.  For a good time, check out Atlassian's "Dragon Slayer" Challenge.

I currently do things related to PLM / Windchill

I am excited for the future of software development
